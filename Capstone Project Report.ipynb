    "We are consulting company that was hired to help a client launch a new Italian restaurant in Doha, Qatar. Before we can execute this project, we would need to gather information that will be used to create a convincing proposal. First, the client wants to know who are the top competitors in the Qatar market. Second, he wants a marketing strategy to jumpstart his new restaurant's sales when he enters the market. Third, as a part of his long-term plan, he wants to expand to 2 other locations in Doha and he wants to know where would be the best location to place these branches.\n",

    "To answer the client's first requirement, we need to collect data about the current italian restaurants in Doha. For this we will leverage Foursquare's api to pull data about the italian restaurants in the city including the name, location, as well as their ratings. We will use the seach query \"Italian\" and filter it with category \"Italian Restaurant\". We will also map these findings to visualize the locations of the competitors using folium.\n",

    "For the second business concern on jumpstarting the sales of the client's new italian restaurant, we have decided to collaborate with a discount app company to gain more exposure and therefore, drive more sales. We will be using the discount app's data to figure out a location where we can use this marketing platform to maximize our revenue. That is, exploring areas where customers use discount apps for food purchases. We will use folium to map the top restaurants in terms of discount app usage and look at areas where the results are most dense. This will indicate where we should launch the restaurant and yield the best results of this marketing strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we want find the most optimal locations for launching new branches of the restaurant. For this we will cluster restaurants from the discount app dataset to group them according to areas. The clustering method we will use is kmeans clustering, with 3 clusters. The same way we decided where to launch the primary branch, we will look at the locations where the usage of discount apps is most dense with the use of folium mapping.\n",

These restaurants are Italian Job, Ciao, La Dolce, Castello Restorante Italiano, Alejandro's Italian Kitchen, and Jamie's Italian. We found that Castello Restorante Italiano and Alejandro's Italian hasn't been rated yet. Italian Job's rating is 7.3, the rest have the same rating of 7.8.\n",

Most restaurant outlets were covered under cluster 0, areas where most out these top performing outlets in terms of discount redemption are located. We see that within each cluster areas, there are saturated locations where it would be best to locate branches if the restaurant were to continue in the direction of using discount apps for marketing.\n",

These three, as the top rated, Italian Restaurants in Doha, would be indicators of the performance of the Italian Restaurant market. Next, we would recommend opening the primary branch along C-Ring Road to optimize the marketing strategy.
