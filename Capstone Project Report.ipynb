Before we can execute this project, we would need to gather information that will be used to create a convincing proposal. First, the client wants to know who are the top competitors in the Qatar market. Second, he wants a marketing strategy to jumpstart his new restaurant's sales when he enters the market. Third, as a part of his long-term plan, he wants to expand to 3 other locations in Doha and he wants to know where would be the best location to place these branches.\n",
